# Text Sequence Prediction

Welcome to the Text Sequence Prediction repository! This project focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict the next sequence of text based on input data. It's an exciting area of study in natural language processing (NLP) that can be applied to a variety of tasks such as auto-completion, chatbot functionality, and more.

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and datasets used in developing a text sequence prediction model. The model uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) units, to understand and generate plausible text sequences based on the provided training data.

## Features

- **Text Generation**: Generate text sequences that are contextually relevant and syntactically correct.
- **Model Training Interface**: Train the model with custom datasets.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to be easily integrated into other applications requiring text prediction capabilities.

## Built With

- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For creating and training the neural network models.
- **Numpy**: Used for handling numerical operations.
